AIT Project

===

One day I wanted to try myself in AI programming. This is Artifical Intelligence Test project.
Project now contains a lot of sources, but it couldn't be compiled, because this files are from my different projects and they must be modified to work together.
I am not doing a lot of commits now, because I'm having exams in my university, but I am planning to develop this project after exams on my holidays.

Sorry for my english, it is not my native language.
